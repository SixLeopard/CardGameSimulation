simulation of a card game i made

this simulation wasd used to show what the chance that any given player will win for all the 13 different ways to play the game to show that “Equal value” (name of game) is fair enough. Theoretical calculations and computer simulations of the game where used to show that the chance of winning for either player is close to equal.
The game is asymmetric as player 1 goes first then player 2. This gives player 1 the possibility of winning on their first go. Compared to if the game was symmetric both players would go at the same time instead of on alternating turn. This gives the first player a slight advantage although the game should still be fair enough as the chance of player 1 winning on their first turn is very low
How to play:
1.	To play the game you need 2 standard decks of 52 cards and 2 players.
2.	Either player 1 or player 2 randomly picks up 1-13 cards of unique face value from the second deck. Those cards are then placed off to the side facing up.
3.	player 1 picks up the same number of cards from the first deck and compares the value of each card to the cards off to the side. If all the face values match, then they win. If all the cards don’t match, they place all the cards back in the deck and shuffle it.
4.	Player 2 repeats the same process in step 3
5.	The player 1 does the same thing repeating until a player get all the required values.
Planning behind the game:
The game was designed so that there are 13 different chances of either player winning based on how many cards they pick at the start of the game. By picking up the same amount of cards at once as they are trying to get, it removes the need for keeping cards in your hand or remember what you have making the game a lot simpler for people to play. With the game only requiring 2 decks of cards to play its very accessible to everyone as most people already have multiple decks of cards and cards are very inexpensive, if they don’t have them. The game must be mostly fair so that either player doesn’t think the other person has an advantage, but It also had to be asymmetric to make the game more exciting.
